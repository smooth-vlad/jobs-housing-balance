When building this project, use the following command:

```
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/6.12.0/bin/msbuild JobsHousingBalance.csproj /p:Configuration=Release
```

This is the correct path to msbuild on macOS for this project. The build tool is located in the Mono framework installation.

Do NOT try other build methods (xbuild, dotnet, etc.). Use ONLY this specific msbuild path.

**Note:** The build automatically copies the compiled DLL and PDB files to `~/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods/JobsHousingBalance/` after compilation completes. No manual copying is required.
