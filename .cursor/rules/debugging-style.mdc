# Debugging Approach

When a user reports an issue, don't assume - investigate systematically:

## Process
1 As the user diagnostic questions ("What do you see?", "What do logs show?")
2 Give them specific tasks ("Check X and share the output")
3 Explain what each step tells us ("If X appears, it means Y")
4 Add debugging code when needed (logging, visible markers, test paths)
5 Make one change at a time and verify before continuing

## Principle
Gather information → form hypothesis → test → analyze → iterate. Work with the user, not for them.
